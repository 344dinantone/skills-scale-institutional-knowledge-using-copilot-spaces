# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes balance structured delivery with adaptability, ensuring efficient product development and stakeholder alignment. Our approach emphasizes clear ownership, iterative delivery, and continuous improvement while maintaining transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

## Project Initiation

Projects begin with a clear initiation phase using a **Project One-pager** to define:
- Business need and problem statement
- Success metrics and measurable outcomes
- Key stakeholders and champions
- High-level timelines and milestones
- Initial risk assessment

This structured approach ensures alignment before committing resources and moving into detailed planning.

## Planning Process

Planning breaks work into actionable backlog items with:
- Clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Mapped dependencies and identified risks
- Defined milestones and delivery checkpoints
- Resource allocation and timeline estimates
- Dedicated templates and checklists for consistency

## Roles and Responsibilities

Roles are clearly defined to ensure accountability and effective collaboration:

- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules, risks, and communications; facilitate team meetings and maintain project transparency
- **Product Managers**: Define product vision, prioritize the backlog, measure outcomes, and ensure customer value delivery
- **Developers**: Implement features, write tests, participate in code reviews, and help identify technical risks
- **QA Specialists**: Validate features against acceptance criteria, perform manual testing for critical releases, and ensure quality standards
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, approvals, and guidance; participate in reviews and decision-making

## Communication Strategies

Communication is intentional and structured to maintain alignment:

- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute focused updates on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly Delivery Syncs**: Progress demonstrations, risk reviews, and decision-making
- **Regular Stakeholder Updates**: Monthly briefings or milestone-based communications
- **Ad-hoc Escalations**: Clear escalation paths for urgent issues and blockers

All communication maintains a single source of truth through project documentation and boards.

## Execution and Tracking

Progress is tracked on project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects) with work moving through defined stages:

1. **Backlog**: Prioritized items ready for refinement
2. **Ready**: Items with clear acceptance criteria, ready to start
3. **In Progress**: Active development work
4. **In Review**: Code review and peer feedback
5. **QA**: Quality validation and testing
6. **Done**: Completed and deployed

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality assurance is integrated throughout the development lifecycle:

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Mandatory for all new logic and features
- **Integration Tests**: Validate component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Smoke tests for critical user flows before release
- **CI-Driven Checks**: Automated linting, security scans, and test execution

### Manual Testing
- Manual QA for critical releases and complex features
- Feature acceptance validation against defined criteria
- Usability and edge case testing

### Security and Code Quality
- Security scanning in continuous integration pipelines
- Code review requirements (at least one approval before merge)
- Small pull requests (â‰¤400 lines when possible) for better review quality

## Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is fostered through:

- **Regular Retrospectives**: Scheduled at project milestones or sprint boundaries
- **Action Item Tracking**: Documenting and following through on improvement opportunities
- **Metrics and Measurement**: Tracking velocity, success metrics, and key signals
- **Blameless Culture**: Encouraging feedback, learning, and psychological safety

This ensures projects are executed with rigor, transparency, and a commitment to learning and excellence.
